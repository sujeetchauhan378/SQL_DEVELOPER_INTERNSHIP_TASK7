##Interview Questions & Answers – SQL Views

1. What is a view?
A view is a virtual table in SQL that is based on the result of a query. It does not store data itself but retrieves data from underlying tables when accessed.

2. Can we update data through a view?

Yes, but only if:
The view is based on a single table.
It does not contain aggregations, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, UNION, or JOIN.
The database allows updates through that view.

3. What is a materialized view?
A materialized view stores the query result physically. It can be refreshed manually or automatically and is used to improve performance for frequently executed queries.

5. How to drop a view?
DROP VIEW view_name;

6. Why use views?

Simplify complex SQL queries
Provide data abstraction
Enhance security by restricting access to certain columns/rows
Maintain reusable SQL logic

7. Can we create indexed views?

Yes, in some databases (like SQL Server) you can create indexed views for better performance.
In MySQL, views cannot have indexes directly.

8. How to secure data using views?

Grant access to the view instead of the base table, exposing only necessary columns or filtered rows.

9. What are limitations of views?

Cannot always be updated
Performance can be slower for complex queries
Depends on underlying table structure (if table changes, view might break)

10. How does WITH CHECK OPTION work?

It ensures that all INSERT or UPDATE operations through the view satisfy the view’s WHERE condition.
Example: CREATE VIEW IT_Employees AS
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE department = 'IT'
WITH CHECK OPTION;
